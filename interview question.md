# Advanced Git and GitHub Interview Questions
## Author: Sikander Kanojia
## Date: $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
## Version: 2.0

## Basic Level Questions

### 1. What is Git and why is it used?
**Answer:**
Git is a distributed version control system that:
- Tracks changes in source code during development
- Enables multiple developers to work simultaneously
- Maintains history of all changes
- Allows branching and merging of code
- Works offline and is fast for most operations
- Ensures data integrity using SHA-1 hashes

### 2. What are the key components of Git?
**Answer:**
1. **Working Directory**: Where you modify files
2. **Staging Area (Index)**: Where you prepare commits
3. **Local Repository**: Contains all commits (.git folder)
4. **Remote Repository**: Server-side repository (like GitHub)

### 3. Explain the Git workflow
**Answer:**
Basic Git workflow consists of:
1. `git clone/init` - Start a repository
2. `git add` - Stage changes
3. `git commit` - Save changes locally
4. `git push` - Upload to remote
5. `git pull` - Download and merge changes

## Intermediate Level Questions

### 4. What's the difference between Git merge strategies?
**Answer:**
Common merge strategies:
1. **Fast-forward**: When no additional work has been done on the base branch
2. **Recursive**: Default strategy for merging branches with divergent history
3. **Octopus**: For merging multiple branches
4. **Ours**: Forces conflicting changes to be auto-resolved using our branch
5. **Theirs**: Forces conflicting changes to be auto-resolved using their branch

### 5. Explain Git rebase and its dangers
**Answer:**
- **Purpose**: Reapplies commits on top of another base
- **Command**: `git rebase <branch>`
- **Dangers**:
  - Rewrites commit history
  - Can cause conflicts in shared branches
  - Should not be used on public branches
- **Golden Rule**: Never rebase shared branches

### 6. What are Git hooks and their types?
**Answer:**
Git hooks are scripts that run automatically before or after Git commands:
1. **Pre-commit**: Runs before commit is created
2. **Post-commit**: Runs after commit is created
3. **Pre-push**: Runs before push is executed
4. **Post-receive**: Runs on remote after push is received
Common uses:
- Code linting
- Running tests
- Checking commit message format
- Triggering deployments

## Advanced Level Questions

### 7. Explain Git internals and objects
**Answer:**
Git stores data in four types of objects:
1. **Blob**: Stores file content
2. **Tree**: Stores directory structure
3. **Commit**: Stores commit information
4. **Tag**: Stores tag information
Each object is identified by SHA-1 hash.

### 8. How do you handle large files in Git?
**Answer:**
Options for handling large files:
1. **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**:
   - Stores large files separately
   - Uses pointers in repository
   - Better performance
2. **git-annex**:
   - Manages files without checking content into Git
3. **Submodules**:
   - Separate repositories for large components
Best practices:
- Use .gitignore for build artifacts
- Use Git LFS for binary files
- Split large repositories if possible

### 9. Explain Git reflog and its importance
**Answer:**
- Git reflog tracks all reference changes
- Useful for:
  - Recovering deleted commits
  - Undoing reset operations
  - Finding lost work
- Commands:
  - `git reflog show`
  - `git reflog expire`
  - `git reflog delete`

### 10. Advanced branching strategies
**Answer:**
1. **GitFlow**:
   - master/main
   - develop
   - feature/*
   - release/*
   - hotfix/*

2. **GitHub Flow**:
   - main branch
   - feature branches
   - Pull Request workflow

3. **Trunk-Based Development**:
   - Short-lived feature branches
   - Frequent integration to main
   - Feature flags for incomplete work

## Expert Level Questions

### 11. How do you optimize Git repository performance?
**Answer:**
1. **Repository optimization**:
   - `git gc` - Garbage collection
   - `git prune` - Remove unreachable objects
   - `git repack` - Optimize pack files

2. **Working practices**:
   - Regular cleaning of merged branches
   - Using shallow clones when appropriate
   - Implementing Git LFS for large files
   - Using sparse-checkout for monorepos

### 12. Explain Git cherry-pick and when to use it
**Answer:**
- **Purpose**: Apply specific commits to current branch
- **Usage**: `git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`
- **Common scenarios**:
  - Applying hotfixes across branches
  - Moving specific features to release
  - Recovering specific commits
- **Cautions**:
  - Creates duplicate commits
  - Can cause conflicts
  - Should be used sparingly

### 13. Advanced Git troubleshooting
**Answer:**
1. **Debugging techniques**:
   - `git bisect` for finding bugs
   - `git blame` for code archaeology
   - `git log --grep` for commit search
   - `git fsck` for repository integrity

2. **Common issues**:
   - Detached HEAD state
   - Merge conflicts
   - Lost commits
   - Repository corruption

### 14. GitHub-specific features and best practices
**Answer:**
1. **GitHub Actions**:
   - CI/CD automation
   - Custom workflows
   - Matrix testing

2. **Security features**:
   - Dependabot alerts
   - Code scanning
   - Secret scanning
   - Security policies

3. **Collaboration features**:
   - Pull Request templates
   - Issue templates
   - Project boards
   - GitHub Discussions

### 15. Git and DevOps integration
**Answer:**
1. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Automated testing
   - Build verification
   - Code quality checks

2. **Continuous Deployment**:
   - Automated releases
   - Environment promotion
   - Rollback strategies

3. **GitOps practices**:
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Configuration management
   - Deployment automation
```

To organize this:

1. Create a new directory:
```bash
mkdir "Advanced Git Github Interview Questions"
```

2. Create the markdown file:
```bash
cd "Advanced Git Github Interview Questions"
touch Advanced_Git_Github_Interview_Questions.md
```

3. Copy the content above into the file.
